In this function, port is a parameter, and when the function is called, its value will be pushed onto the stack. 
The ebp register is often used as a frame pointer, and it points to the base of the function's stack frame. The ebp register is typically set up by the function prologue.

The function insb is called, and port is passed as an argument.
The function prologue sets up the stack frame and saves the previous value of ebp on the stack.
The ebp register is set to the current value of esp, establishing a frame pointer.
The function parameter port is pushed onto the stack.
Here,[ebp+8] refers to the location of the port parameter within the function's stack frame:

[ebp] refers to the saved previous ebp value (typically 4 bytes).
[ebp+4] refers to the return address (typically 4 bytes).
[ebp+8] refers to the port parameter (typically 2 bytes for an unsigned short).
